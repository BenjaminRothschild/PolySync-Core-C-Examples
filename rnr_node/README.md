### rnr_node
This is an example of both the Record and Replay API, and the coupled Logfile API.
It is an example of a node which listens and responds to the `ps_rnr_msg` messages, which command the node to use Logfile API resources that facilitate synchronized record and replay across all nodes on the system
You would use this example if you needed a node to log incoming messages (that itâ€™s subscribed to), to be able to replay later
   PolySync provides the dynamic drivers that record sensor data, but you may also want to record the algorithm inputs/outputs for reasons

### Dependencies
Packages: libglib2.0-dev
To install on Ubuntu
`sudo apt-get install <package>`

### Building and Running the Node
```bash
$ cd rnr_node
$ make
$ ./bin/polysync-rnr-node-c 
```
