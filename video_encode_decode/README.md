### video_encode_decode

This is an exmaple of the Video API. You would use this example if you need a node to talk directly to a video device, and didnâ€™t want to use the `video-device` driver provided by PolySync, which supports all V4L USB video devices.

This example connects to a USB webcam (that must be Video4Linux (V4L) compatible), encodes the sensor data, and then decodes the same image stream to show the image processing pipeline.

This DOES NOT connect to a node defined in the SDF, it connects directly to the hardware device using the Video API.

### Hardware requirements

Video Device:  USB webcam

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-0

To install on Ubuntu: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install <package>
```

### Building and Running the Node

```bash
$ cd video_encode_decode
$ make
$ ./bin/polysync-video-encode-decode-c 
```
