### serial_reader
You would use this as a reference if you needed a node to listen to a device over a serial connection.
This example creates and reads data through a serial connection, to a hardware device, or another software application.
It exercises the Serial API.
It pairs nicely with the `serial_writer` example.

### Hardware requirements
